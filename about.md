Cobunny is a filmmaker who obviously hasnâ€™t made any famous film yet, so she plays with computers and reads the internet instead.  Her free time is typically spent with her family whom she enjoys advising on tech issues for their phones and computers.   She dreams of a long relaxed vacation of course, with a little bit of adventure, just enough to inspire her, but not too far out of her comfort zone.  She recently learned to swim, and her next goal is to get on a boat and learn to dive.   She currently lives in Los Angeles and  is very pleased with the weather.
