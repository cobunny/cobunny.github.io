##Having Some Common Sense

Sometimes, you don’t have to be technical to be able to solve issues.  In fact, there are so many technical issues that can be solved or avoided just by having some common sense.
 
For example, if you don’t know what your app does or what features you need to add,  why not ask yourself why you need to build an application and what tools you need before you have even started installed it. If you don’t know what methods to use, try the simplest one first to see if it fits.  If it fits, then you’re done.

No one wants their hard work to be ruined.  Protect your work before you optimize it.  Always watch out for the system's security, and chose the safest options possible to set up your development environment and communication methods for sending and receiving data from the internet.

In a word, do the things that make sense to you and even you've made mistakes, at least you know what doesn’t work. 

##Trial and Error

In the past, you could use 'cheat codes' on some video games by pressing on a key a number of times until miraculously your character comes back to life.  Trial and error still seems to be a golden rule for the coding game today.  Because most of the time there are discoveries or clues that always come with experimenting.

##Be Creative 

Learning can be fun and creative.  Try to find some interesting projects to do, starting small and building bigger. It's always good to keep your interests and curiosity growing, so that you'll want to learn more.

It’s also important to walk away from your computer during a long hour and forget your coding problems.  This will refresh your brain and maybe help you get a fresh perspective.

##The Shortcut : Get help
Asking for help is a great way to learn. There is always someone awesome who is willing to help.  Maybe a little push is all you need to solve the problem in your code.
